# Dark Mode Coding Challenge 🌙 &nbsp; ![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow) ![time](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%8F%B0-30m-blue)

&nbsp;

# Goals / Outcomes ✨

- Using state and global state
- DOM manipulation

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ✅

None

&nbsp;

# Requirements 📖

- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the _existing_ dark-mode button
  - Utilise the _existing_ dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to the root `html` element
- When in Dark mode:

  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.

- Provide a global solution for the state ( Use Context)
  &nbsp;
- Theme will automatically get converted to dark mode after 5000ms (timeout)

# Think about 💡

- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
- How we can apply a class to the `html` DOM element

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done 🏁

- Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
